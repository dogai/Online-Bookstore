The Online Bookstore Project is a web application aimed at providing a secure platform for users to buy and sell books online.
The project includes several key features such as a main page displaying available books, a sign-in page for user authentication,
and a secondhand sale page for users to list their own books for sale. Future plans for the project involve adding functionalities
like cart management for users and an admin login for site management.

Compatibility across all major web browsers is prioritized to ensure a seamless user experience for all visitors to the site.
